# password-generator-week-3.v2

This is the 3rd challenge and it was a Password Generator assignemt 
I am aware of the lack of code that would make it so that the project 
would have a default option if someone were to not select any prompts but 
I could not write a proper while loop or could find any other way to approach that 
issue. 

This assignment was a challenge in many ways. 

Starting with what knowledge I though I had was the hardesr part 
because it felt like I had no idea where to begin.

I decided to try some different resources and looked at different 
YouTube projects that had similar guidelines and were written in 
JavaScript. Just starting with this helped me find a much better outline for 
how I wanted to approach the project and also helped me find many solutions 
for the math side of this project. 

I included the screenshot of my original attempt at this project, this 
was not the final result because of a lot of errors I found and also 
how overcomplicated I realized I was making it.
